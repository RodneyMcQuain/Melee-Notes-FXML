# Melee-Notes-FXML
Rewrite of a previous vJavaFX project using FXML, the original project repo can be found at: https://github.com/RodneyMcQuain/Melee-Notes. The original vJavaFX project became messy and difficult to maintain with its poor architectural pattern. So, in effort to make this program more maintainable I started a rewrite with FXML using MVC pattern.

This rewrite is currently lacking the following features of the original project: money notes, player notes, character notes, analysis notes, mentality notes, statistics, tournament report, and money report.
