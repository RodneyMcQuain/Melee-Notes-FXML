# Melee-Notes-FXML
Rewrite of a previous vJavaFX project using FXML, the original project repo can be found at: https://github.com/RodneyMcQuain/Melee-Notes. This project was taken on to strengthen my by design principles and provide better orgarnization and scalability through clean coding principles and MVC design pattern.

This rewrite is currently lacking the following features from the original project: money notes, player notes, character notes, analysis notes, mentality notes, statistics, tournament report, and money report.
